# Statistical Models in Biology
STATS215 	&middot; Winter 2020 &middot; Stanford University

## Course Description
This course is about probabilistic models in biology and the statistical inference algorithms necessary to fit them to data. We will cover some of the most important tools for modeling biological data, including latent variable models, hidden Markov models, dynamical systems, Poisson processes, and modern extensions of these models that use deep learning.  We will study algorithms for parameter estimation and inference, and we will apply these tools to a variety of problems across biology, with a particular emphasis on applications in neuroscience.  As part of the homework assignments, you will implement these models and algorithms in Python and apply them to real data.  

## Prerequisites
You should be comfortable with the basics of probability at the level of STAT116, including random variables, joint densities, conditional distributions, etc.  You should also be familiar with maximum likelihood estimation, for example from STAT200.  We will use basic linear algebra (solving linear systems and using eigendecompositions) and multivariable calculus (gradients, Jacobians, Hessians, etc.).
